The program is in JDK 22, and I used IntelliJ IDE.

MainApplication.java    PlayScreenController.java   GameController.java
game.fxml               play.fxml                   turn.fxml

This program involves a JavaFX GUI. To run the program, go to MainApplication.java
and press the run button to display a new window.

The window will prompt "Play".
Press Play, then choose whose turn it is you want to go first.

If you choose computer, then the window will shift to the game with the
computer already going. If you choose you, you will go first.

Either way, it will be your turn next. Choose a color and the amount
of circles you want to remove and press end turn. This will remove the amount you
have inputted and the computer will go right after you. Once you or the computer wins,
a play again button will pop up. Press it if you'd like to play again. There's also a
text area at the bottom of the window narrating everything going on in case you get lost.

Double Trouble is an instantiation of the game, Nim. In 1902, C. L. Bouton,
a mathematician at Harvard University, "solved" it.
